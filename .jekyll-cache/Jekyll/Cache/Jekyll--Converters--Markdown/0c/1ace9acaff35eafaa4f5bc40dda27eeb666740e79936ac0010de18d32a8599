I"W<p>Hi, this is Qiao Xue :)) <br /> ‘Qiao’ pronounces like ‘Ciao’ in Italian greetings, and it means ‘‘High Mountains’’ in ancient Chinese. <br /> I am now a visiting undergrad at Department of Astrophysics and Astronomy, U of Chicago (US), working with Prof. Jacob Bean to characterize exoplanet atmosphere with JWST data!</p>
